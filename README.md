## Translations

To make it harder to miss which language (scope) you're submitting a definition under, the app's
interface is supposed to be translated to match whichever language you select. Help is needed to
complete these translations! You can contribute
on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/toadua-android/ui/).
